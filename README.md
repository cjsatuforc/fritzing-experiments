FRITZING EXPERIMENTS
====================

Simple toy projects based on the [Fritzing creator kit](http://fritzing.org/creatorkit) and some additional parts.

Contains the Arduino, Processing and Fritzing sketches.

See [my Google+ album](https://plus.google.com/photos/106550818727370453007/albums/5975507440855889889) for demo images and movies.

# SevenSegmentDisplay

Use a seven segment display to show digits. The buttons toggle between different modes.

# Countdown

Show a countdown on a seven segment display and start a motor. Combines parts from the Fritzing creator kit with others from the Kosmos Easy Electronic box.

# Lichtsucher

A photo sensor in the head of the Fritzing Cardboard Bot is used to find the brightest spot. This can be used to track a flashlight.

# RoboFaceTracker

A Processing sketch which uses the Arduino firmata firmware. Uses a webcam and OpenCV for Processing to detect faces. Makes the Fritzing Cardboard Bot always look at you.

# SlotCarTimer

Uses the photo sensor to build a light barrier to measure lap times of a slot car racer. Lap and race times are shown on a 16x2 character display and printed on the serial port. The Arduino can be used standalone. You can additionally use the Processing sketch to overlay a webcam capture of your race with the race times.
